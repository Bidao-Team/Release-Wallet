## About Bidao
The BiDao Cryptocurrency (BID) utilizes a completely decentralized proof-of-stake Blockchain with an additional collateral-backed value token which is 100% stable in value quite in contrast to for example Bitcoin, Binance Coin or Ethereum [1] which experience huge fluctuation. 

As Settlement Layer the BiDao system utilizes the Binance-chain. This means that you can also freely interact with all crypto assets that are running on Binance-chain. In future, BiDao will be also integrated with other Blockchains like Ethereum, Tezos, and EOS. This way BiDao becomes the one-stop-shop for Decentralized Finance (Defi) applications
